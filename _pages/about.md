Born in Little Rock, Arkansas and attended University of Central Arkansas and Memphis State University, earning a degree in Graphic Design, Kristi has been an artist since she was a child and an art teacher for 20 years, concentrating on mosaics, painting, and ceramics.

Kristi is best known for her completion of several large scale mosaics in Memphis including: the “Stone Butterfly” and “Seedling Circle” Mosaics in the Memphis Botanic Garden’s My Big Back Yard Children’s Garden; White Station Middle School’s “Terrarum Orbis” 26' x 26' Mosaic , and the “Tree of Life” mosaic in the Richard and Annette Bloch Cancer Survivors Park (a park which she co-designed). Kristi's focus for many years has been public art projects involving community participation: the Hickory Hill mural was designed using the artwork of the children of the Hickory Hill Middle School. The “Tree of Life”mosaic featured tiles made by cancer survivors, and at White Station Middle Kristi worked with all 1100 students and faculty to create tiles for the “Map” mosaic. She has worked with the Memphis Grizzlies Community Foundation completing several mosaic projects in tandem with their Community Court initiative in different community centers in Memphis. Last Spring Kristi worked with the middle school students at Hutchison designing and creating a mosaic around the chapel door.

Photographing and drawing the beauty of nature and creating nature inspired art in clay, mosaic, and paintings are her passion. Kristi finds beauty even in nature's decay and overlooked flora and fauna such as fungus, caterpillers, insects, and reptiles. Kristi also work as a naturalist leading hikes and fishing trips for inner city kids for Memphis Kids in Nature. Kristi loves teaching because it allows her, along with her students, to play with materials, explore new ideas, learn something, and have fun.
